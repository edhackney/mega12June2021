# Instructions

# * Create two different variables that will take the input of your first name and your neighbor's first name.

# * Create two more inputs that will ask how many months each of you has been coding.

# * Finally, display a result with both your names and the total amount of months coding.
names1 = input("what is the first name?")
names2 = input("what is the second name?")
time1 = input(names1 + ", how many months have you been coding?")
time2 = input(names2 + ", how many months have you been coding?")
print(names1 + " has been coding " +str(time1 + " months"))
print(names2 + " has been coding " +str(time2 + " months"))
